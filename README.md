# Parameterized ALU using Function in Verilog

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a *parameterized Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)* in *Verilog HDL*, designed for flexibility and reusability.
The ALU supports a wide range of arithmetic and logical operations using *functions* for clean and modular coding.
By using parameters, the ALU can be configured for different *bit-widths* (e.g., 4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit), making it scalable for various digital design applications.

## ✨ Key Features

* ✅ *Parameterized Design* – Change data width easily using a parameter.
* ✅ *Function-based Implementation* – Clean and modular code structure.
* ✅ *Arithmetic Operations* – Addition, subtraction, increment, decrement, etc.
* ✅ *Logical Operations* – AND, OR, XOR, NOT, shift, etc.
* ✅ *Zero & Carry Flags* – Status flags for result analysis.
* ✅ *Reusable & Scalable* – Can be integrated into larger digital systems.

## 🛠 Tools Used

* *HDL*: Verilog
* *Simulator*: ModelSim / QuestaSim (or any Verilog simulator)
* *Target*: FPGA/ASIC implementation ready
